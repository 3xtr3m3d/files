### Background definitions
# You can define as many backgrounds as you want. Tint2 automatically identifies each background
# with a number starting from 1 (1, 2, ...). Afterwards, you can apply a background to objects
# (panel, taskbar, task, clock, systray) using the background id. Identifier 0 refers to a special
# background which is fully transparent, identifer 1 applied the first background defined in the
# config file etc.

## Background 1: panel
#
# The corner radius (number_of_pixels).
rounded = 7
#
# The border width in pixels.
border_width = 1
#
# background_color/border_color = color opacity , where color is specified in hex RGB, e.g. #ff0000
# (red), and opacity varies from (0 to 100), where 0 is fully transparent, 100 is fully opaque.
# Note that for a transparent panel you need to enable a desktop compositor such as compton or
# compiz.
background_color = #000000 60
border_color = #FFFFFF 16

## Background 2: normal/iconified tasks
rounded = 5
border_width = 0
background_color = #777777 20
border_color = #777777 30

## Background 3: active tasks
rounded = 5
border_width = 1
background_color = #777777 20
border_color = #ffffff 40

## Background 4: urgent tasks
rounded = 5
border_width = 1
background_color = #aa4400 100
border_color = #aa7733 100

## Background 5: tooltips
rounded = 2
border_width = 1
background_color = #ffffaa 100
border_color = #999999 100

### Panel

# Defines the items tint2 will show and the order of those items. Each letter refers to an item: L
# shows the Launcher, T shows the Taskbar, S shows the Systray (also called notification area), B
# shows the Battery status, C shows the Clock, F adds an extensible spacer (has no effect if T is
# also present).

# Use all to get a separate panel per monitor.

# orientation (horizontal, vertical).

# panel_size = width height , where width and height can be specified without units (e.g. 123) as
# pixels, or followed by % as percentages of the monitor size (e.g. 50%). Use 100% for full monitor
# width/height.
panel_size = 100% 30

# The margins define the distance between the panel and the horizontal/vertical monitor edge. Use 0
# to obtain a panel with the same size as the edge of the monitor (no margin).

#   follow_size means that the maximized windows always resize to have a common edge with tint2.
#   minimum means that the maximized windows always expand to have a common edge with the hidden

#   close : close the task
#   toggle : toggle the task
#   iconify : iconify (minimize) the task
#   toggle_iconify : toggle or iconify the task
#   maximize_restore : maximized or minimized the task
#   shade : shades (collapses) the task
#   desktop_left : send the task to the desktop on the left
