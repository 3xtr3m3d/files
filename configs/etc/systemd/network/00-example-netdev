#[NetDev]
#Description=

# The interface name used when creating the netdev. This option is compulsory.
#Name=

# The netdev kind. This option is compulsory. One of: bond, bridge, dummy, gre, gretap, ip6gre,
# ip6tnl, ip6gretap, ipip, ipvlan, macvlan, macvtap, sit, tap, tun, veth, vlan, vti│, vti6, vxlan
#Kind=

#The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are
# supported and are understood to the base of 1024. This key is not currently supported for "tun"
# or "tap" devices.
#MTUBytes=

# The MAC address to use for the device. If none is given, one is generated based on the interface
# name and the machineid(5). This key is not currently supported for "tun" or "tap" devices.
#MACAddress=

#[Bridge]
# HelloTimeSec specifies the number of seconds between two hello packets sent out by the root
# bridge and the designated bridges. Hello packets are used to communicate information about the
# topology throughout the entire bridged local area network.
#HelloTimeSec=

# MaxAgeSec specifies the number of seconds of maximum message age. If the last seen (received)
# hello packet is more than this number of seconds old, the bridge in question will start the
# takeover procedure in attempt to become the Root Bridge itself.
#MaxAgeSec=

# ForwardDelaySec specifies the number of seconds spent in each of the Listening and Learning
# states before the Forwarding state is entered.
#ForwardDelaySec=

#[Bond]
# Specifies one of the bonding policies. The default is "balance-rr" (round robin). Possible values
# are "balance-rr", "active-backup", "balance-xor", "broadcast", "802.3ad", "balance-tlb", and
# "balance-alb".
#Mode=

# Selects the transmit hash policy to use for slave selection in balance-xor, 802.3ad, and tlb
# modes. Possible values are "layer2", "layer3+4", "layer2+3", "encap2+3", "802.3ad", and
# "encap3+4".
#TransmitHashPolicy=

# Specifies the rate with which link partner transmits Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit
# packets in 802.3ad mode. Possible values are "slow", which requests partner to transmit LACPDUs
# every 30 seconds, and "fast", which requests partner to transmit LACPDUs every second. The
# default value is "slow".
#LACPTransmitRate=

# Specifies the frequency that Media Independent Interface link monitoring will occur. A value of
# zero disables MII link monitoring. This value is rounded down to the nearest millisecond. The
# default value is 0.
#MIIMonitorSec=

# Specifies the delay before a link is enabled after a link up status has been detected. This value
# is rounded down to a multiple of MIIMonitorSec. The default value is 0.
#UpDelaySec=

# Specifies the delay before a link is disabled after a link down status has been detected. This
# value is rounded down to a multiple of MIIMonitorSec. The default value is 0.
#DownDelaySec=

# Specifies the number of seconds between instances where the bonding driver sends learning packets
# to each slave peer switch. The valid range is 1–0x7fffffff; the default value is 1. This option
# has an effect only for the balance-tlb and balance-alb modes.
#LearnPacketIntervalSec=

# Specifies the 802.3ad aggregation selection logic to use. Possible values are "stable",
# "bandwidth" and "count".
#AdSelect=

# Specifies whether the active-backup mode should set all slaves to the same MAC address at the
# time of enslavement or, when enabled, to perform special handling of the bond's MAC address in
# accordance with the selected policy. The default policy is none. Possible values are "none",
# "active" and "follow".
#FailOverMACPolicy=

# Specifies whether or not ARP probes and replies should be validated in any mode that supports ARP
# monitoring, or whether non-ARP traffic should be filtered (disregarded) for link monitoring
# purposes. Possible values are "none", "active", "backup" and "all".
#ARPValidate=

# Specifies the ARP link monitoring frequency in milliseconds. A value of 0 disables ARP monitoring.
# The default value is 0.
#ARPIntervalSec=

# Specifies the IP addresses to use as ARP monitoring peers when ARPIntervalSec is greater than 0.
# These are the targets of the ARP request sent to determine the health of the link to the targets.
# Specify these values in IPv4 dotted decimal format. At least one IP address must be given for ARP
# monitoring to function. The maximum number of targets that can be specified is 16. The default
# value is no IP addresses.
#ARPIPTargets=

# Specifies the quantity of ARPIPTargets that must be reachable in order for the ARP monitor to
# consider a slave as being up. This option affects only active-backup mode for slaves with
# ARPValidate enabled. Possible values are "any" and "all".
#ARPAllTargets=

# Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave. This affects how the primary slave is
# chosen to become the active slave when failure of the active slave or recovery of the primary
# slave occurs. This option is designed to prevent flip-flopping between the primary slave and
# other slaves. Possible values are "always", "better" and "failure".
#PrimaryReselectPolicy=

# Specifies the number of IGMP membership reports to be issued after a failover event. One
# membership report is issued immediately after the failover, subsequent packets are sent in each
# 200ms interval. The valid range is 0–255. Defaults to 1. A value of 0 prevents the IGMP
# membership report from being issued in response to the failover event.
#ResendIGMP=

# Specify the number of packets to transmit through a slave before moving to the next one. When set
# to 0, then a slave is chosen at random. The valid range is 0–65535. Defaults to 1. This option
# only has effect when in balance-rr mode.
#PacketsPerSlave=

# Specify the number of peer notifications (gratuitous ARPs and unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor
# Advertisements) to be issued after a failover event. As soon as the link is up on the new slave,
# a peer notification is sent on the bonding device and each VLAN sub-device. This is repeated at
# each link monitor interval (ARPIntervalSec or MIIMonitorSec, whichever is active) if the number
# is greater than 1. The valid range is 0–255. The default value is 1. These options affect only
# the active-backup mode.
#GratuitousARP=

# Specifies that duplicate frames (received on inactive ports) should be dropped when false, or
# delivered when true. Normally, bonding will drop duplicate frames (received on inactive ports),
# which is desirable for most users. But there are some times it is nice to allow duplicate frames
# to be delivered. The default value is false (drop duplicate frames received on inactive ports).
#AllSlavesActive=

# Specifies the minimum number of links that must be active before asserting carrier. The default
# value is 0.
#MinLinks=
