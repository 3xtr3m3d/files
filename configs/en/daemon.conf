# Configuration file for the PulseAudio daemon. See pulse-daemon.conf(5) for more information.
# Use either ; or # for commenting.

# Daemonize after startup. Takes a boolean value, defaults to "no".
daemonize = yes

# Fail to start up if any of the directives in the configuration script default.pa fail. Takes a
# boolean argument, defaults to "yes".
fail = yes

# Allow/disallow module loading after startup. This is a security feature that if disabled makes
# sure that no further  modules may be loaded into the PulseAudio server after startup completed.
# It is recommended to disable this when system-instance is enabled. Please note that certain
# features like automatic hot-plug support will not work if this option is enabled. Takes a boolean
# argument, defaults to "yes". 
allow-module-loading = yes

# Allow/disallow exit on user request. Defaults to "yes".
allow-exit = yes

# Create a PID file in the runtime directory ($XDG_RUNTIMEDIR/pulse/pid). If this is enabled you may
# use commands like --kill or --check. If you are planning to start more than one PulseAudio process
# per user, you better disable this option since it effectively disables multiple instances. Takes
# a boolean argument, defaults to "yes".
use-pid-file = yes

# Run the daemon as system-wide instance, requires root privileges. Takes a boolean argument,
# defaults to "no".
system-instance = no

# Please don't use this option if you don't have to! This option is currently only useful when you
# want D-Bus clients to use a remote server. This option may be removed in future versions. If  you
# only want to run PulseAudio in the system mode, use the system-instance option. This option takes
# one of "user", "system" or "none" as the argument. This is essentially a duplicate for the
# system-instance option. The difference is the none option, which is useful when you want to use a
# remote server with D-Bus clients. If both this and system-instance are defined, this option
# takes precedence. Defaults to whatever the system-instance is set.
#local-server-type = user

# Enable data transfer via POSIX shared memory. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to "yes".
enable-shm = yes

# Sets the shared memory segment size for the daemon, in bytes. If left unspecified or is set to 0,
# it will default to some system-specific default, usually 64 MiB. Please note that usually there
# is no need to change this value, unless you are running an OS kernel that does not do memory
# overcommit.
shm-size-bytes = 0

# Locks the entire PulseAudio process into memory. While this might increase drop-out safety when
# used in conjunction with realtime scheduling, this takes away a lot of memory from other processes
# and might hence considerably slow down your system. Defaults to "no".
lock-memory = no

# If disabled do not install the CPU load limiter, even on platforms where it is supported. This
# option is useful when debugging/profiling PulseAudio to disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals. Takes
# a boolean argument, defaults to "no".
cpu-limit = yes

# Renice the daemon after startup to become a high-priority process. This a good idea if you
# experience drop-outs during playback. However, this is a certain security issue, since it works
# when called SUID root only, or RLIMIT_NICE is used. root is dropped immediately after gaining the
# nice level on startup, thus it is presumably safe. See pulseaudio(1) for more information. Takes
# a boolean argument, defaults to "yes".
high-priority = yes

# Try to acquire SCHED_FIFO scheduling for the IO threads. The same security concerns as mentioned
# above apply. However, if  PA enters an endless loop, realtime scheduling causes a system lockup.
# Thus, realtime scheduling should only be enabled on trusted machines for now. Please not that only
# the IO threads of PulseAudio are made real-time. The controlling thread is left a normally
# scheduled thread. Thus enabling the high-priority option is orthogonal. See pulseaudio(1) for more
# information. Takes a boolean argument, defaults to "yes".
realtime-scheduling = yes

# The realtime priority to acquire, if realtime-scheduling is enabled. Note: JACK uses 10 by
# default, 9 for clients. Thus it is  recommended to choose the PulseAudio real-time priorities
# lower. Some PulseAudio threads might choose a priority a little lower or higher than the specified
# value. Defaults to "5".
realtime-priority = 5

# The nice level to acquire for the daemon, if high-priority is enabled. Note: on some distributions
# X11 uses -10 by default. Defaults to "-11".
nice-level = -15

# Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this time in seconds passed. Use a negative
# value to disable this feature. Defaults to "20".
exit-idle-time = 20

# Unload autoloaded sample cache entries after being idle for this time in seconds. Defaults to 20.
scache-idle-time = 20

# The path were to look for dynamic shared objects (DSOs/plugins). You may specify more than one
# path separated by colons. The default path depends on compile time settings.
#dl-search-path = (depends on architecture)

# The default configuration script file to load. Specify an empty string for not loading a default
# script file. The default behaviour is to load ~/.config/pulse/default.pa, and if that file does
# not exist fall back to the system wide installed version /etc/pulse/default.pa. If run in
# system-wide mode the file /etc/pulse/system.pa is used instead. If -n is passed on the command
# line or default-script-file is disabled the default configuration script is ignored.
default-script-file = /etc/pulse/default.pa

# Load the default configuration script file as specified in default-script-file. Defaults to "yes".
load-default-script-file = yes

# The default log target. Use either stderr, syslog, journal (optional), auto, file:PATH or
# newfile:PATH. On traditional systems auto is  equivalent to syslog. On systemd-enabled systems,
# auto is equivalent to journal, in case daemonize is enabled, and to stderr otherwise. If set to
# file:PATH, logging is directed to the file indicated by PATH. newfile:PATH is otherwise the same
# as file:PATH, but existing files are never overwritten. If the specified file already exists,
# a suffix is added to the file name to avoid overwriting. Defaults to "auto".
log-target = auto

# Log level, one of debug, info, notice, warning, error. Log messages with a lower log level than
# specified  here are not logged. Defaults to notice. The -v command line option might alter this
# setting.
log-level = notice

# With each logged message log the code location the message was generated from. Defaults to "no".
log-meta = no

# With each logged messages log the relative time since startup. Defaults to "no".

# stack frames. Defaults to 0.
log-backtrace = 0

# The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of  src-sinc-best-quality, src-sinc-medium-quality,
# src-sinc-fastest, src-zero-order-hold, src-linear, trivial, speex-float-N, speex-fixed-N, ffmpeg.
# See the documentation of libsamplerate and speex for explanations of the different src- and
# speex- methods, respectively. The method trivial is the most basic algorithm implemented. If
# you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the other hand it has the worst quality of them all.
# The Speex resamplers take an integer quality setting in the range 0..10 (bad...good). They exist
# in two flavours: fixed and float. The former uses fixed point numbers, the latter relies on
# floating point numbers. On most desktop CPUs the float point resampler is a lot faster, and it
# also offers slightly better quality. See the output of dump-resample-methods for a complete list
# of all available  resamplers. Defaults to speex-float-1. The available resamplers. Defaults to
# "speex-float-1" on most achitectures and speex-fixed-1 on ARM. Note that some modules overwrite or
# allow overwriting of the resampler to use.
resample-method = speex-float-10

# If disabled never upmix or downmix channels to different channel maps. Instead, do a simple
# name-based matching only. Defaults to "yes".
enable-remixing = yes

# If disabled when upmixing or downmixing ignore LFE channels. When this option is disabled the
# output LFE channel will only get a signal when an input LFE channel is available as well. If no
# input LFE channel is available the output LFE channel will always be 0. If no output LFE channel
# is available the signal on the input LFE channel will be ignored. Defaults to "no".

#  s24_32le - Signed 24 bit integer PCM in LSB of 32 bit words, little endian.
#  s24_32be - Signed 24 bit integer PCM in LSB of 32 bit words, big endian.
#
# The floating point sample formats have the range from -1.0 to 1.0. Depending on the endianness of

# With  the flat volume feature enabled, the sink HW volume is set to the same level as the highest
# volume input stream. Any other streams (with lower volumes) have the appropriate adjustment
# applied in SW to bring them to the correct overall level. Sadly hardware mixer changes cannot be
# timed accurately and thus this change of volumes can sometimes cause the resulting output sound
# to be momentarily too loud or too soft. So to ensure SW and HW volumes are applied concurrently
# without any glitches, their application needs to be synchronized. The sink implementation needs
# to support deferred volumes. The following parameters can be used to refine the process.
#
# Enable deferred volume for the sinks that support it. This feature is enabled by default.
